The below link showes the difference between the http1.1 and http2

http://imagekit.io/demo/http2-vs-http1?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=Blog

short comes of the http1.1 was more prominent when the more and more data was loaded in single page

1.ONE OPEN REQUEST PER CONNECTION:

http1.1 practically supports only one outstnding request per tcp connection (thougth the http 
pipeline supports more the one outstanding request)

browsers avoid this limitations by having muliple parallel tcp connections to every domain 

number of parallel connection varied per browser.

Dupplication of the data:

duplication of data accross the request (header and cookies)

this leds to devolepment of techniques like image sprites and domain sharding.

Advantages of HTTP/2

http/2 was buid over google's spdy protocol 

Multiplexed insted of ordered :

(allows using same tcp connection for mutiple parallel request)


Header compression using HPACK:

(compressed header,redused data redundancy)

server push :

instead of wating for the client to request for the asserts like js and css, the 
server can push the resourses it belives required by the client.so it avoid the round trip.
